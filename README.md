# How to use javascript/es7 *decorators* and es6 *proxies*.

**This is a work in progress so _check back soon_!**

Stuff I plan to add:
* How to write helpfull `@decorator` functions.
* Different options to compile down to _es5_.
* What are _proxies_ and how to make/use them.
* What does typescript have to offer?...

**Let me know if you would like to see something else here!**
